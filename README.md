## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather conditions in any city. Users can view the current weather as well as a 5-day weather forecast for any city they search for. Each searched city is saved to a search history list, enabling users to quickly view weather data for cities they have previously searched.

## Features
